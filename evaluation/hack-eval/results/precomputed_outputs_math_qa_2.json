    "a shopkeeper sold an article offering a discount of 5 % and earned a profit of 31.1 % . what would have been the percentage of profit earned if no discount had been offered ?": "## Step 1: Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the article is $100.\nThis is a simplification as the actual cost price can be any value.\n\n## Step 2: With a 5% discount, the selling price (SP1) is $75.\nWe can calculate the selling price using the formula SP = CP - (5% of CP), which gives SP1 = $100 - $5 = $95.\n\n## Step 3: The profit earned after the discount is 31.1% of the cost price.\nThis is calculated as 31.1% of $100, which is 0.311 * 100 = $31.10.\n\n## Step 4: The selling price after the discount is $95, and the profit earned is $31.10.\nWe can calculate the original selling price (SP2) by adding the profit to the selling price after discount, which gives SP2 = $95 + $31.10 = $126.10.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we calculate the cost price (CP2) without the discount, using the formula CP2 = SP2 / (1 + Profit Percentage).\nCP2 = $126.10 / (1 + 0.311) = $126.10 / 1.311 = $96.\n\n## Step 6: The profit earned without the discount is $31.10.\nWe can calculate the percentage profit without the discount by dividing the profit by the cost price and multiplying by 100, which gives (($31.10 / $96) * 100 = 32%).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",

    "there are 28 stations between hyderabad and bangalore . how many second class tickets have to be printed , so that a passenger can travel from any station to any other station ?": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible journeys between two stations.\nTo find the total number of possible journeys between any two stations, we need to consider that from each station, it can travel to all other stations. Since there are 28 stations, from each station, there are a certain number of journeys to other stations. We need to calculate this number.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the nature of the problem.\nSince each station can travel to all other stations, this is a complete graph where every vertex (station) has an equal number of edges (journeys) connecting it to every other vertex.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph.\nThe formula for the number of edges (E) in a complete graph with n vertices (stations) is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\]\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the number of stations into the formula.\nWe have 28 stations, so the total number of edges (and hence, possible journeys) is:\n\\[ E = \\frac{28(28-1)}{2} = \\frac{28 \\times 27}{2} = 378 \\]\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of second-class tickets needed.\nSince each journey requires a ticket, the total number of second-class tickets needed is equal to the total number of possible journeys. Therefore, there are 378 second-class tickets that need to be printed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{378}$",
    "the present population of a town is 3888 . population increase rate is 20 % p . a . find the population of town before 2 years ?": "## Step 1: Calculate the population increase rate\nThe population increase rate is 20% per annum. To find the population increase rate per period, we need to divide it by 100. So, the increase rate per period is 20 / 100 = 0.2.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of periods\nSince the increase rate is applied per annum, there are 3 periods in 2 years (2 * 12 = 24 months, so there are 3 periods).\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for population increase\nUse the formula: new population = old population * (1 + increase rate per period) ^ number of periods.\n\n## Step 4: Find the old population\nWe are given the new population (3888) and the increase rate (0.2). We need to find the old population. Let's call the old population x. We can write the equation: x * (1 + 0.2) ^ 3 = 3888. We need to find x.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nx * (1.2) ^ 3 = 3888\nx * 1.728 = 3888\nx = 3888 / 1.728\nx = 2265\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2265}$",

    "the sum of all the integers s such that - 26 < s < 24 is": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of integers in the given range\nSince the range is from -26 to 24, we need to calculate the number of integers within this range. The first integer is -25, and the last integer is 24. To find the number of integers, we subtract the first integer from the last integer and add 1 (since we are counting both endpoints). number_of_integers = 24 - (-25) + 1 = 50.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of an arithmetic series\nThe given range forms an arithmetic series with the first term (a) being -26, the last term (l) being 24, and the number_of_integers being 50. We need to calculate the sum of this series. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n/2)(a + l), where 'n' is the number_of_integers.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to calculate the sum\nNow we apply the formula using the values of 'n', 'a', and 'l'. sum = (50/2)(-26 + 24) = 25 * (-2) = -50.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-50}$",
    "a full stationary oil tank that is a right circular cylinder has a radius of 100 feet and a height of 25 feet . oil is pumped from the stationary tank to an oil truck that has a tank that is a right circular cylinder until the truck ' s tank is completely filled . if the truck ' s tank has a radius of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet , how far ( in feet ) did the oil level drop in the stationary tank ?": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck. This can be done using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius of the truck's tank and h is its height.\n\n## Step 2: Plug in the values for the truck's tank\nThe truck's tank has a radius of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet. So we plug these values into the formula: V_truck = \u03c0(6)^2 * 10.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck\nNow we can calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck: V_truck = \u03c0(6)^2 * 10 = 3.14159 * 36 * 10 = 1094.72 cubic feet.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the initial volume of oil in the stationary tank\nThe initial volume of oil in the stationary tank is equal to the volume of the entire tank: V_stationary = \u03c0(100)^2 * 25 = 3.14159 * 10000 * 25 = 785000 cubic feet.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck in terms of the stationary tank's volume\nThe volume of oil pumped to the truck is the same as the initial volume of oil in the stationary tank: V_pumped = V_stationary = 785000 cubic feet.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final height of the oil in the stationary tank\nLet h be the drop in the oil level in the stationary tank. Then, the volume of oil in the stationary tank after pumping is V_pumped - V_stationary. We know that this volume is equal to the volume of the truck's tank. So, we can set up the equation: \u03c0(100)^2 * (10-h) = V_pumped - V_stationary.\n\n## Step 7: Plug in the known values\nWe plug in the values for the truck's tank and the initial volume of oil in the stationary tank: \u03c0(100)^2 * (10-h) = 785000 - 785000.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation: \u03c0(10000) * (10-h) = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for h\nDivide both sides by \u03c0(10000): (10-h) = 0. Then, solve for h: h = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

We know that the volume of chili paste is the same in both types of cans.\n\n## Step 2: We are given two pieces of information: first, that the restaurant must order 20 more of the smaller cans than the larger cans, which can be expressed as S = L + 20. Second, we know that the total volume of chili paste is the same for both types of cans, which can be represented by the equation 35L + 25S = 20(35) since we have 35-ounce and 25-ounce cans.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute S = L + 20 from the first equation into the second equation: 35L + 25(L + 20) = 20(35).\n\n## Step 4: Expand the equation: 35L + 25L + 500 = 700.\n\n## Step 5: Combine like terms: 60L + 500 = 700.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract 500 from both sides of the equation: 60L = 200.\n\n## Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 60 to find L: L = 200 / 60.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction to find L: L = 10 / 3.\n\n## Step 9: However, the number of cans must be a whole number, so we made a calculation error in step 8. Let's correct that by properly solving for L.\n\n## Step 10: Correcting the error, we should multiply 25L + 500 = 700.\n\n## Step 11: Subtract 500 from both sides of the equation: 25L = 200.\n\n## Step 12: Divide both sides by 25: L = 8.\n\n## Step 13: Now that we have L, we can find S using S = L + 20: S = 8 + 20.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for S: S = 28.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",
