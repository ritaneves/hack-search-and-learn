    "a full stationary oil tank that is a right circular cylinder has a radius of 100 feet and a height of 25 feet . oil is pumped from the stationary tank to an oil truck that has a tank that is a right circular cylinder until the truck ' s tank is completely filled . if the truck ' s tank has a radius of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet , how far ( in feet ) did the oil level drop in the stationary tank ?": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of oil pumped to the truck\nTo find the volume of oil pumped to the truck, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. The truck's tank is a right circular cylinder with a radius of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet. So, the volume of oil pumped to the truck is: V_truck = \u03c0(6)^2(10) = 360\u03c0.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial volume of oil in the stationary tank\nThe tank is a right circular cylinder with a radius of 100 feet and a height of 25 feet. To find the initial volume of oil in the tank, we use the same formula: V = \u03c0r^2h. So, the initial volume of oil in the tank is: V_initial = \u03c0(100)^2(25) = 250,000\u03c0.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of oil that was pumped\nSince the truck's tank was completely filled, the volume of oil pumped to the truck is equal to the initial volume of oil in the tank: V_pumped = V_initial = 250,000\u03c0.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the volume of oil remaining in the tank\nThe volume of oil remaining in the tank is the difference between the initial volume and the volume pumped: V_remaining = V_initial - V_pumped = 250,000\u03c0 - 250,000\u03c0 = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the change in oil level in the tank\nSince the volume of oil remaining is 0, the change in oil level is 0. However, we need to consider the radius of the tank. The change in oil level can be calculated by dividing the volume of oil that was pumped (which is equal to the initial volume of oil in the tank) by the cross-sectional area of the tank. This gives us: \u0394h = V_pumped / (\u03c0r^2) = 250,000\u03c0 / (\u03c0(100)^2) = 250,000 / 10,000 = 25 feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",

The profit made by the retailer on each item is $40, which is 10% of the cost price. So, we can write the equation: 0.10 * CP = 40. Solving for CP gives us CP = 400.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the selling price of each item before the discount.\nThe selling price before the discount is the cost price plus the profit, which is 0.10 * CP + 40 = 0.10 * 400 + 40 = 140.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the selling price of each item after the discount.\nThe discount is 5% of the original selling price, so we can calculate the selling price after the discount: 0.95 * 140 = 133.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total revenue generated by selling the items at the selling price after the discount.\nSince each item is sold 100 times a month, the total revenue generated is 100 * 133 = 13300.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total cost of purchasing the items.\nLet's denote the number of items to be sold as x. The total cost of purchasing the items is then x * 400.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the profit made by the retailer after the discount.\nThe profit made by the retailer is the total revenue generated minus the total cost of purchasing the items, which is 13300 - x * 400.\n\n## Step 7: Set up an inequality to justify the discount policy.\nThe retailer wants to justify the discount policy, so the profit made after the discount must be greater than the total cost of purchasing the items. Therefore, the inequality is: 13300 - x * 400 > x * 400.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the inequality.\nCombine like terms and solve for x: 13300 > 2x * 400. Divide both sides by 800: 16.25 > x.\n\n## Step 9: Round up to the nearest whole number since we can't sell a fraction of an item.\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum number of items the retailer needs to sell to justify the discount policy is 17.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

Since 14 copies were sold, the number of hardback copies sold is 14 - P.\n\n## Step 3: Write the equation for the total value of the remaining books.\nThe value of hardback books is 10 * $20 = $200, and the value of paperback books is 45 * $10 = $450. The total value of the remaining books is $460.\n\n## Step 4: Write the equation based on the total value.\n$200 + $450 = $460\n\n## Step 5: Equate the equation and solve for P.\n$650 = $460\n$200 = $460 - $650\n$200 = -$400\n$700 = $400\nThis means that the total value of the remaining books is actually $700, not $460. We need to adjust our understanding of the problem.\n\n## Step 6: Adjust the understanding of the problem.\nSince the problem states that 14 copies were sold and we already know the original number of paperbacks is 45, the number of paperbacks sold can be calculated as 14 - 10 = 4. This means the correct setup should not involve finding the total value of the remaining books but rather the number of paperbacks sold.\n\n## Step 7: Correct the equation setup.\nLet's denote the number of paperback copies sold as P. Since 14 copies were sold, the number of hardback copies sold is 14 - P.\n\n## Step 8: Write the correct equation.\nThe equation should reflect the total number of books sold, which is 14 + (10 - P), and the total number of copies sold is 10 + P.\n\n## Step 9: Set up the correct equation.\n14 + (10 - P) = 10 + P\n\n## Step 10: Solve the equation for P.\n14 + 10 - P = 10 + P\n24 - P = 10 + P\n24 - 10 = P + P\n14 = 2P\nP = 14/2\nP = 7\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

Given 1000 sculptures are not on display, these are 2/3 of the total sculptures. Since 1/6 of the displayed pieces are sculptures, 5/6 of the displayed pieces are not sculptures. We know 1000 sculptures are not on display, which is 2/3 of all sculptures.\n\n## Step 3: Find the total number of sculptures.\nSince 1000 sculptures represent 2/3 of all sculptures, we can find the total number of sculptures by solving the equation: 2/3 * Total Sculptures = 1000.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the total number of sculptures.\nTo find Total Sculptures, multiply both sides by 3/2: Total Sculptures = 1000 * (3/2) = 1500.\n\n## Step 5: Find the total number of pieces of art.\nSince 1/3 of the pieces are displayed, and we now know 1/6 of the displayed pieces are sculptures, we can use this information to find the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces as P. The number of displayed pieces is 2/3P.\n\n## Step 6: Set up an equation using the information about sculptures.\nSince 1000 sculptures are not on display, this is 1/6 of the displayed pieces, which are 2/3P. We know that 1/6 * (2/3P) = 1000.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation to find the total number of pieces of art.\nMultiply both sides by 6*3 to eliminate the fractions: 2/3P * 6 * 3 = 6*3*1000.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify and solve the equation.\nTo solve for P, simplify the equation: 36P / 3 = 18000. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator: 36P = 18000 * 3.\n\n## Step 9: Continue simplifying and solving the equation.\n36P = 54000. Now divide both sides by 36 to solve for P: P = 54000 / 36.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate P.\nP = 1500.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1500}$",

The rest, 20% of 1000 workers, worked 50 hours, so 0.2 * 1000 = 200 workers.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by each group.\nThe 300 workers who worked 15 hours worked a total of 300 * 15 = 4500 hours. The 500 workers who worked 40 hours worked a total of 500 * 40 = 20000 hours.

Therefore, A + B + C = 300.\n\n## Step 3: When the wallpaper is overlapped to cover a wall with an area of 180 square meters, the area covered with exactly two layers of wallpaper is 34 square meters. This can be expressed as B = 34.\n\n## Step 4: The total area covered with exactly two layers can also be expressed as (A + B + C) - 2C = 180, because B is subtracted once from the total because it is counted twice when adding A and C.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute B = 34 into the equation from Step 4 to solve for A + C.

So, we need to calculate the number of the 400-meter section before Maple Street.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of the 400-meter section before Maple Street\nSince there are 5 sections in total (from Pine Street to Maple Street), 400 meters in each section, we can calculate the number of the 400-meter section before Maple Street by subtracting 1 from the total number of sections.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of the 400-meter section before Maple Street\n5 sections - 1 = 4 sections\n\n## Step 9: Determine the highest numbered street before Maple Street\nSince 400 meters is equivalent to 1 block, and we are 400 meters into the section, we need to subtract 1 from the 400-meter section to find the 1st street of the 400-meter section.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the highest numbered street that intersects Oak Street\nSince we know the numbering pattern starts at 1st Street, we will count up one block for each 400-meter section until we reach the 400-meter section before Maple Street.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the highest numbered street that intersects Oak Street\nWe first count the first 400 meters from Pine Street, which gives us the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd streets; the next 400 meters from Pine Street will give us the 4th and 5th and 6th and 7th streets; and the next 400 meters will give us the 8th and 9th and 10th and 11th streets.\n\n## Step 12: Conclude the highest numbered street\nThe highest numbered street that intersects Oak Street is therefore the 9th street.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

    "kim finds a 4 - meter tree branch and marks it off in thirds and fifths . she then breaks the branch along all the markings and removes one piece of every distinct length . what fraction of the original branch remains ?": "## Step 1: Marking off the branch in thirds and fifths\nKim marks the 4-meter tree branch in thirds, which means each section is 4/3 meters long. Then, she marks the branches in fifths, which means each section is 4/5 meters long.\n\n## Step 2: Determining the lengths of the marked sections\nNow, we need to determine the lengths of the sections after Kim breaks the branch along all the markings. To do this, we multiply the lengths of the sections by the number of sections each is divided into.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the total number of distinct lengths\nTo find the total number of distinct lengths, we need to consider all the sections. This will be 3 (for thirds) + 5 (for fifths) = 8 distinct lengths.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the lengths of the broken sections\nNow, let's find the lengths of the broken sections.\n\n- For thirds, the first section is 4/3 meters long, and the last section is (4/3) * (3/4) = 1 meter long.\n- For fifths, the first section is 4/5 meters long, and the last section is (4/5) * (4/5) = 16/25 meters long.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the total length removed\nWe multiply the lengths of the sections by the number of sections each is divided into to find the total length removed.\n\n- For thirds, 3 * (4/3) = 4 meters.\n- For fifths, 5 * (4/5) = 4 meters.\n\n## Step 6: Subtracting the length of the broken sections from the original length\nNow, we subtract the total length of the broken sections from the original length to find the remaining length.\n\n- Remaining length = Original length - Total length removed\n- Remaining length = 4 - (4 + 4) = 4 - 8 = -4 meters\n\nHowever, a negative length doesn't make sense in this context, so let's re-examine our calculation.\n\n## Step 7: Re-examining the calculation\nWe should multiply the number of sections by the length of the sections to find the total length removed, and then subtract that from the original length.\n\n- Total length removed = 3 * (4/3) + 5 * (4/5) = 4 + 16/5 = 4 + 3.2 = 7.2 meters\n- Remaining length = Original length - Total length removed = 4 - 7.2 = -3.2 meters\n\nHowever, as before, a negative length doesn't make sense, so we need to re-look at our steps.\n\n## Step 8: Re-examining our steps\nOur previous steps contained errors. Instead of breaking the branch along all markings, we should have broken the branch into smaller pieces and calculated the remaining length.\n\n## Step 9: Recalculating the remaining length\nWe should recalculate the remaining length by breaking the branch into smaller pieces and summing up the lengths.\n\n- First, break the branch into 8 equal pieces. The first piece is 4/3 meters long, and the last piece is 2 meters long.\n- Now we can calculate the remaining length by subtracting the lengths of the broken sections from the original length.\n\n## Step 10: Calculating the remaining length\nThe first section is 4/3 meters long, and the last section is 4/5 meters long. To find the remaining length, we need to subtract the sum of these lengths from the original length.\n\n- Remaining length = Original length - (First section + Last section)\n- Remaining length = 4 - ((4/3) + (4/5))\n- Finding a common denominator: (4/3) + (4/5) = (20/15) + (12/15) = 32/15\n- Remaining length = 4 - 32/15\n- Converting 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 15: 4 = 60/15\n- Remaining length = 60/15 - 32/15 = 28/15\n\n## Step 11: Simplifying the fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n## Step 12: Finding the greatest common divisor\nWe need to find the greatest common divisor of 28 and 15.\n\n## Step 13: Calculating the greatest common divisor\nThe greatest common divisor of 28 and 15 is 1.\n\n## Step 14: Simplifying the fraction\nSince the greatest common divisor is 1, the fraction 28/15 cannot be simplified further.\n\n## Step 15: Converting the fraction to a decimal\nTo convert the fraction 28/15 to a decimal, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\n## Step 16: Calculating the decimal value\n28 / 15 = 1.86667\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{28}{15}}$",

We know that the combined work rate of 6 men and 8 women is 1/10 of the work per day. Therefore, we can write the equation: 6M_w + 8W_w = 1/10.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the work rate of 26 men and 48 women\nSimilarly, for 26 men and 48 women, we can write the equation: 26M_w + 48W_w = 1/2.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns: 6M_w + 8W_w = 1/10 and 26M_w + 48W_w = 1/2. We can multiply the first equation by 13 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate the fractions: 78M_w + 104W_w = 13/10 and 52M_w + 96W_w = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the second equation from the first\n(78M_w - 52M_w) + (104W_w - 96W_w) = 13/10 - 1, which simplifies to 26M_w + 8W_w = 13/10 - 1 = -7/10.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for W_w\nDivide both sides by 8: W_w = (-7/10) / 8 = -7/80.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute W_w back into one of the original equations\nSubstituting W_w = -7/80 into the first equation: 6M_w + 8(-7/80) = 1/10.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for M_w\nSimplifying the equation: 6M_w - 7/10 = 1/10. Add 7/10 to both sides: 6M_w = 1/10 + 7/10 = 8/10 = 4/5.

    "two consultants can type up a report in 12.5 hours and edit it in 7.5 hours . if mary needs 30 hours to type the report and jim needs 12 hours to edit it alone , how many t hours will it take if jim types the report and mary edits it immediately after he is done ?": "## Step 1: Determine the combined work rate of Mary and Jim\nTo find out how long it would take Jim and Mary together to complete the report, we first need to determine their combined work rate. Mary can type the report in 12.5 hours, so her work rate is 1/12.5 reports per hour. Jim can edit the report in 7.5 hours, so his work rate is 1/7.5 reports per hour.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate\nThe combined work rate of Mary and Jim is the sum of their individual work rates. Combined work rate = Mary's work rate + Jim's work rate = 1/12.5 + 1/7.5 reports per hour.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the combined work rate\nTo simplify the combined work rate, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12.5 * 7.5 = 93.75. So, Mary's work rate can be converted to 7.5/93.5 and Jim's work rate can be converted to 2/25. The combined work rate is (7.5/93.5) + (2/25).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combined work rate\nWe can now calculate the combined work rate by adding the two fractions. Combined work rate = (7.5/93.5) + (2/25) = (7.5*25 + 2*93.5)/93.5 = (187.5 + 185)/93.5 = 372.5/93.5 = 4/1 or 4.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the time needed for Jim and Mary to work together\nWith a combined work rate of 4 reports per hour, we can now calculate the time needed for Jim and Mary to work together to complete the report. Time needed = 1 / combined work rate = 1 / 4 = 0.25 hours.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the time needed for Jim to type the report\nNow that we have the combined work rate, we can calculate the time needed for Jim to type the report. Time needed to type = 1 / Mary's work rate = 1 / (7.5/93.5) = 93.5 / 7.5 = 12.5 hours.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the time needed for Mary to edit the report\nNow that we have the time needed for Jim to type the report, we can calculate the time needed for Mary to edit the report. Time needed to edit = 1 / Jim's work rate = 1 / (2/25) = 25 / 2 = 12.5 hours.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total time needed\nFinally, we can calculate the total time needed for Jim and Mary to work together to complete the report. Total time needed = Time needed for Jim to type + Time needed for Mary to edit = 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",

We can continue to find the units digit of higher powers of 347 by multiplying the units digit of the previous power by 7. Since the units digit of 347^1 is 7, the units digit of 347^2 is 9, the units digit of 347^3 is 3, the units digit of 347^4 is 7, and the pattern repeats.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the units digit of 347^83\nSince the pattern of the units digit of 347^n repeats, we can find the units digit of 347^83 by finding the remainder when the exponent 83 is divided by 4, which is 3. Therefore, the units digit of 347^83 is the same as the units digit of 347^3, which is 3.\n\n## Step 6: Combine the units digits of 734^100 and 347^83\nNow, we can combine the units digits of 734^100 (4) and 347^83 (3). 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

There are four possible cases: (1) x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0, (2) x \u2265 0 and y < 0, (3) x < 0 and y \u2265 0, and (4) x < 0 and y < 0.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze case 1\nIf x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0, then |x| = x and |y| = y. Substituting these values into the given equations, we get: x + x + y = 7 and x - y = 5. Simplifying the equations, we get: 2x + y = 7 and x - y = 5. Adding these two equations, we get: 3x = 12, which implies x = 4. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get: 4 - y = 5, which implies y = -1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze case 2\nIf x \u2265 0 and y < 0, then |x| = x and |y| = -y. Substituting these values into the given equations, we get: x + x + y = 7 and x + y = 5. Simplifying the equations, we get: 2x + y = 7 and x + y = 5. Since x + y = 5 contradicts the first equation, this case is not possible.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze case 3\nIf x < 0 and y \u2265 0, then |x| = -x and |y| = y. Substituting these values into the given equations, we get: x - x + y = 7 and x - y = 5. Simplifying the equations, we get: y = 7 and x - y = 5. Substituting y = 7 into the second equation, we get: x - 7 = 5, which implies x = 12. However, this contradicts the assumption that x < 0. So, this case is also not possible.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze case 4\nIf x < 0 and y < 0, then |x| = -x and |y| = -y. Substituting these values into the given equations, we get: x - x + y = 7 and x + y = 5. Simplifying the equations, we get: y = 7 and x + y = 5. Since y = 7 contradicts the second equation, this case is also not possible.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for x + y\nBased on the analysis of the four cases, we have found that the only valid solution is x = 4, y = -1.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate x + y\nNow that we have found the values of x and y, we can calculate x + y: x + y = 4 + (-1) = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "a 240 m long train running at the speed of 120 km / hr crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 km / hr in 9 sec . what is the length of the other train ?": "## Step 1: First, let's calculate the relative speed of the two trains since they are moving in opposite directions. \nThe relative speed of two objects moving in opposite directions is the sum of their speeds. To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by 5/18.\nRelative speed = 120 km/hr * 5/18 = 33.33 m/s.\n\n## Step 2: We know that the total distance covered when the two trains pass each other is the sum of their lengths.\nTime taken to pass each other is 9 seconds.\nUsing the formula speed = distance / time, we can calculate the total distance covered.\nDistance covered = relative speed * time taken = 33.33 m/s * 9 s = 297 m.\n\n## Step 3: Since the distance covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, we can subtract the length of the first train (240 m) from the total distance to find the length of the second train.\nLength of the second train = Total distance - Length of the first train = 297 m - 240 m = 57 m.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
    "34 . the side surface of a cylinder is rolled with a rectangular plate . if the perimeter of the circular base is 9 feet , and the diagonal of the rectangular plate was 15 ft . what is height of the of the cylinder ?": "## Step 1: First, we need to find the radius of the circular base of the cylinder.\nWe are given that the perimeter of the circular base is 9 feet, which means 2 * pi * radius = 9. We can solve for radius: radius = 9 / (2 * pi).\n\n## Step 2: Now that we have the value of radius, we can find the circumference of the circular base, which will also be the length of the side of the rectangular plate.\nThe circumference of the circular base is 2 * pi * radius. We can use this to find the length of the side of the rectangular plate: side_length = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * (9 / (2 * pi)).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for the side length of the rectangular plate.\nside_length = 9.\n\n## Step 4: We know that the diagonal of the rectangular plate is 15 feet. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the side lengths of the rectangular plate to its diagonal.\nLet's denote the height of the cylinder as h. Since the side length of the rectangular plate is 9, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: (side_length)^2 + h^2 = diagonal^2.\n\n## Step 5: Plug in the values and solve for h.\nWe have (9)^2 + h^2 = (15)^2. Expanding the equation: 81 + h^2 = 225. Subtracting 81 from both sides: h^2 = 144. Taking the square root of both sides: h = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

The concentration is 30% of the total volume, which is (9 + x) liters.\n\n## Step 4: Write an equation based on the acidity level.\n4.5 = 0.3 * (9 + x)\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation to find the value of x.\nTo solve for x, we start by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.3:\n   15 = 9 + x\n   Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   6 = x\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
